<p>The dark web is a hidden part of the world wide web that can only be accessed using a special browser known as Tor. Dark web pages don’t appear when you look for them in a search engine, so you need to know the exact address of the website you want to visit.
This part of the internet is usually described as “dangerous.” The widely-known stereotype is that the dark web is where all sorts of shady things happen, from dealing illegal drugs to hiring hitmen. While there are definitely dangers lurking in the dark web, it’s also home to more than just illegal marketplaces.
The dark web can be a safe place for journalists and whistleblowers to communicate freely. Citizens from countries with strict internet regulations can also use the dark web to talk openly.
